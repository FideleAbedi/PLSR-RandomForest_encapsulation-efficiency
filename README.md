# PLSR - Random Forest - Encapsulation efficiency
This repository presents an analysis of the encapsulation efficiency of micronutrients using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Random Forest Regression

## Overview

### Introduction
This project leverages Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Random Forest Regression to analyze the encapsulation efficiency of micronutrients. It integrates FTIR spectroscopy data with cell characterization metrics, applying advanced statistical and machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.

### Results
The models demonstrate robust prediction capabilities in understanding encapsulation efficiency. Extensive data analysis and visualization have been utilized to evaluate model performance and interpret the relationship between variables.

## Usage

### Setup
- **Development Environment**: Developed in a Python environment.
- **Dependencies**: Requires Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
- **Data**: The data consists of pre-processed FTIR spectroscopy and cell characterization measurements.
